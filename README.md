# Password Generator

## Description

This project is a password generator that randomizes characters defined by the user's criteria through a series of prompts. With each prompt, it will add characters to an array and at the end, the array will be randomized according to the user's desired password length. This project's HTML and CSS was previously provided and the JavaScript functions were built by me.
